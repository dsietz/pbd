# Privacy by Design (PbD) SDK

For software development teams who implement Privacy by Design practices, this PbD SDK provides enablers to help you easily and transparently applying best practices. Unlike other solutions, this SDK maps directly to the Data Privacy strategies to provide a complete tool kit and saves developers time from having to search, derive, or piece together disparate solutions.
